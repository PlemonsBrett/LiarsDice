# Adapters Implementation Directory

This directory contains implementation files for adapter pattern classes
that provide interface compatibility and external system integration.

## Adapter implementations include

### - RandomNumberGenerator adapters for different RNG libraries

### - Platform-specific implementations (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### - Third-party library integrations and wrappers

### - Database connectivity adapters (if persistence is added)

### - Network communication adapters for multiplayer support

### - File I/O adapters for game state persistence

### - Audio/graphics adapters for enhanced user interfaces

## Adapter pattern benefits

### - Isolates external dependencies from core game logic

### - Enables easy testing through mock implementations

### - Supports multiple platform targets

### - Facilitates dependency injection and inversion of control

### - Provides clean interfaces for complex external systems

## Implementation guidelines

### - Implement corresponding header interfaces from include/liarsdice/adapters/

### - Follow RAII principles for resource management

### - Provide comprehensive error handling and exception safety

### - Include detailed logging for debugging and diagnostics

### - Support configuration through dependency injection

Keep this directory in version control to maintain implementation structure
for adapter pattern components that bridge external systems.

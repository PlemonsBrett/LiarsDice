# Dependency Injection Implementation Directory

This directory contains implementation files for the dependency injection
system that manages object creation and lifetime throughout the application.

# DI system implementations:
# - ServiceContainer implementation for service registration and resolution
# - ServiceFactory implementations for complex object creation
# - Lifecycle management for singleton, transient, and scoped services
# - Configuration-based service registration
# - Automatic dependency resolution and circular dependency detection
# - Plugin system support for modular architecture
# - Service decorators and interceptors for cross-cutting concerns

# Core DI components:
# - Container implementation (.cpp files for SimpleContainer, etc.)
# - Factory pattern implementations for service creation
# - Service locator patterns for legacy code integration
# - Configuration parsers for external service definitions
# - Reflection utilities for automatic service discovery

# Design patterns supported:
# - Constructor injection (primary pattern)
# - Property/setter injection for optional dependencies
# - Method injection for specific scenarios
# - Factory pattern for complex service creation
# - Decorator pattern for service enhancement

# Implementation standards:
# - Thread-safe service resolution and registration
# - Exception-safe object construction and cleanup
# - Memory-efficient container implementation
# - Clear error messages for configuration issues

Keep this directory in version control to house the dependency injection
implementation that enables loose coupling and testable architecture.

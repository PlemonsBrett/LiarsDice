### - Header-only when possible for easy inclusion

### - Minimal dependencies on external libraries

### - Well-tested with comprehensive unit tests

### - Clear, self-documenting function names

### - Const-correct and exception-safe implementations

Keep this directory in version control to maintain consistent library structure
and provide a designated location for shared utility code.

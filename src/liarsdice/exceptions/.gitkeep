# Exceptions Implementation Directory

This directory contains implementation files for the custom exception
hierarchy that provides structured error handling throughout the library.

# Exception implementations include:
# - ExceptionBase implementation with error categorization
# - Game-specific exceptions (InvalidMoveException, GameStateException)
# - Player-related exceptions (PlayerNotFoundException, InvalidPlayerState)
# - Dice-related exceptions (InvalidDiceValueException, DiceConfigurationError)
# - System exceptions (ResourceNotAvailableException, ConfigurationError)
# - Network exceptions for multiplayer scenarios (ConnectionError, TimeoutException)
# - Persistence exceptions for save/load operations

# Exception hierarchy features:
# - Structured error codes and categories
# - Detailed error messages with context information
# - Stack trace capture and reporting capabilities
# - Localization support for user-facing error messages
# - Integration with logging systems for error tracking
# - Serialization support for network error transmission

# Implementation standards:
# - All exceptions inherit from ExceptionBase
# - Provide both error codes and human-readable messages
# - Include contextual information (player ID, game state, etc.)
# - Support exception chaining for complex error scenarios
# - Maintain exception safety guarantees in all operations
# - Follow C++ exception handling best practices

# Error handling philosophy:
# - Use exceptions for exceptional conditions only
# - Prefer error codes for expected failure scenarios
# - Provide recovery mechanisms where possible
# - Log all exceptions with appropriate severity levels

Keep this directory in version control to maintain structured exception
handling implementation that supports robust error management.

# Implementation Detail Headers Directory

This directory contains internal implementation details and private headers
that are not part of the public API but may be shared between source files.

## Types of implementation details

### - Internal helper classes and functions

### - Template metaprogramming utilities

### - Platform-specific implementation details

### - Performance optimization code

### - Internal data structures and algorithms

### - Private member function implementations

### - Compiler-specific workarounds and optimizations

## Design principles

### - Headers in this directory are NEVER included by public headers

### - All symbols should be in anonymous namespaces or detail namespaces

### - Code here can break compatibility between versions

### - No external dependencies should rely on these headers

### - Prefer inline/header-only implementations for small utilities

## Naming conventions

### - Use detail:: namespace for all symbols

### - Prefix file names with module name (e.g., core_utils.hpp)

### - Include comprehensive comments explaining internal logic

Keep this directory in version control to provide a structured location
for implementation details while maintaining clear API boundaries.

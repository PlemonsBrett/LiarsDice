# Benchmarks Directory

This directory is reserved for performance benchmarks and profiling code.
Benchmarks are built when LIARSDICE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON is set in CMake.

## Potential benchmark targets

### - Dice rolling performance tests

### - Game state management efficiency

### - Player action processing speed

### - Memory allocation patterns

### - Random number generator performance

### - Large-scale game simulation benchmarks

## Common benchmark frameworks for C++

### - Google Benchmark (micro-benchmarks)

## - Celero (cross-platform benchmarking)

### - Custom timing utilities

Keep this directory in version control to maintain the project structure
even when benchmarks are not yet implemented.

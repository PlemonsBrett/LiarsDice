# Test Fixtures Directory

This directory contains test data files, mock objects, and reusable test
fixtures that support comprehensive testing across the LiarsDice project.

# Test fixture types:
# - JSON configuration files for game state testing
# - Mock player data and game scenarios
# - Sample dice roll sequences for deterministic testing
# - Test databases or data files for persistence testing
# - Network message samples for communication testing
# - Performance benchmarking data sets
# - Error condition reproduction data

# Fixture organization:
# - Subdirectories by component (core/, adapters/, di/, etc.)
# - Naming convention: component_scenario_fixture.json
# - Versioned fixtures for regression testing
# - Shared fixtures for cross-component integration tests

# Mock object patterns:
# - Mock implementations of core interfaces
# - Fake services for dependency injection testing
# - Stub implementations for external service simulation
# - Test doubles for complex integration scenarios

# Data formats:
# - JSON for structured test data
# - CSV for tabular test datasets
# - Binary files for performance testing scenarios
# - Configuration files for environment setup

# Fixture management:
# - Automated fixture generation for edge cases
# - Fixture validation to ensure test data integrity
# - Version control for fixture evolution
# - Documentation of fixture purpose and usage

Keep this directory in version control to maintain reusable test assets
that ensure consistent and comprehensive test coverage.

# Integration Tests Directory

This directory contains integration tests that verify component interactions
and end-to-end functionality across the LiarsDice system.

# Integration test categories:
# - Component integration tests (Core + DI + Adapters)
# - API integration tests for public library interfaces
# - Database integration tests for persistence functionality
# - Network integration tests for multiplayer scenarios
# - Configuration integration tests for system setup
# - Performance integration tests for system-wide behavior
# - Cross-platform integration tests for portability verification

# Test scenarios covered:
# - Complete game lifecycle from start to finish
# - Player management and interaction workflows
# - Dice rolling and statistical validation
# - Game state persistence and recovery
# - Multi-threaded game execution
# - Error handling and recovery across components
# - Memory management and resource cleanup

# Testing frameworks and tools:
# - Google Test for C++ test structure
# - Custom test harnesses for game simulation
# - Mock servers for network testing
# - Database containers for persistence testing
# - Performance profiling integration
# - Automated test environment setup

# Test execution patterns:
# - Containerized test environments for consistency
# - Automated test data generation and cleanup
# - Parallel test execution for efficiency
# - Continuous integration pipeline integration
# - Regression test automation

# Documentation requirements:
# - Test scenario descriptions and expected outcomes
# - Environment setup and prerequisite documentation
# - Troubleshooting guides for test failures
# - Performance baseline documentation

Keep this directory in version control to maintain comprehensive integration
testing that validates system behavior across component boundaries.

## 1. Project Context and Category 2 Focus

### Building on Category 1 Foundation
This Data Structures and Algorithms enhancement builds directly upon the Software Engineering and Design work completed in Category 1 of this capstone project. The same Liar's Dice artifact is being used across all three enhancement categories, with each category adding specific computer science concepts and improvements.

### Category 2 Scope: Commits 6, 7, and 8 (Completed)
The focus of this category covers the implementation of:
- **Commit 6:** AI Strategy implementations with actual statistical analysis (not just rule-based logic) **COMPLETED**
- **Commit 7:** Custom data structures optimized for gaming applications using modern C++20 standards and Boost libraries **COMPLETED**
- **Commit 8:** Bayesian Inference Engine with Boost.Math for sophisticated AI decision-making **COMPLETED**

**Stretch Goals (Dropped due to time constraints):**
- **Commit 9:** Decision Tree Algorithm with Boost.Graph for advanced AI reasoning
- **Commit 10:** Monte Carlo Simulation Engine with Boost.Random  
- **Commit 11:** Statistical Analysis and Pattern Recognition with Boost
- **Commit 12:** Advanced AI Decision-Making System Integration

### Critical Decision Point: Complete Architecture Redesign
During the early implementation work for Category 2 (specifically when working on AI strategies with statistical analysis), I encountered severe compatibility issues while attempting to integrate multiple open-source libraries with custom implementations, particularly around Catch2 mocking frameworks. After spending over a day debugging these integration issues with no progress and missing the original deadline for commits 7-9, I made the strategic decision to completely rewrite the application from scratch using:

- **Modern C++20 Standards:** Leveraging contemporary language features for better performance and maintainability
- **Boost C++ Libraries:** Utilizing industry-standard, well-tested libraries for mathematical operations, testing, and system utilities  
- **ModernCppStarter Template:** Adopting community best practices for project structure and build systems
- **CMake with CPM:** Modern dependency management using CPM (CMake Package Manager) for reliable library integration

**Rationale:** While this decision required significant additional time to reimplement the foundational game logic, it ultimately unblocked development and provided a much more robust platform for implementing advanced data structures and algorithms. The new architecture better demonstrates professional software development practices and advanced computer science concepts.

### Timeline and Milestone Context
- **Category 1 (Software Engineering and Design):** Commits 1-5 - Foundational architecture, game mechanics, and initial AI framework
- **Category 2 (Data Structures and Algorithms):** Commits 6-8 - Statistical AI strategies, custom data structures, Bayesian inference
- **Category 3 (Databases):** Commits 13-15 - Persistent storage, player statistics, game analytics *(Future work)*

This journal specifically covers the Category 2 enhancements, which represent a significant leap in algorithmic sophistication and computational efficiency over the foundational implementation.

```cpp
template<typename T = GameState>
class GameStateStorage {
private:
    std::vector<T> states_;
    std::unordered_map<player_id_t, std::size_t> player_indices_;
    mutable std::shared_mutex mutex_;
    std::size_t capacity_;
    
public:
    void store_state(player_id_t player_id, const T& state);
    std::optional<T> get_state(player_id_t player_id) const;
    void clear_inactive_players();
};
```

**Key Features:**
- **Hash-based indexing** for O(1) player state lookup

template<typename T, typename Allocator = std::allocator<T>>
class CircularBuffer {
private:
    std::vector<T, Allocator> buffer_;
    std::size_t head_ = 0;
    std::size_t size_ = 0;

    std::vector<T> get_window(std::size_t window_size) const;
    
    template<typename Func>
    auto calculate_statistics(Func transform) const -> 
        std::tuple<double, double, T, T>;  // mean, stddev, min, max
};
```

**Algorithmic Optimizations:**

template<typename Key, typename Value, typename Hash = std::hash<Key>>
class LRUCache {
private:
    struct Node {
        Key key;
        Value value;
        std::shared_ptr<Node> prev, next;
    };
    
    std::unordered_map<Key, std::shared_ptr<Node>, Hash> cache_;
    std::shared_ptr<Node> head_, tail_;
    std::size_t capacity_;
    mutable std::mutex mutex_;
    
public:
    std::optional<Value> get(const Key& key);

class SparseMatrix {
private:
    std::map<std::pair<std::size_t, std::size_t>, T> data_;
    std::size_t rows_, cols_;
    
public:
    void set(std::size_t row, std::size_t col, const T& value);
    T get(std::size_t row, std::size_t col) const;
    SparseMatrix<T> multiply(const SparseMatrix<T>& other) const;
    std::vector<T> multiply_vector(const std::vector<T>& vec) const;
};
```

**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the number of non-zero elements, compared to O(nÂ²) for dense matrices.

### 2.5 Trie-based String Mapping (`trie_map.hpp`)

**Problem Solved:** Efficient prefix-based lookups for command parsing and AI strategy selection.

**Implementation:**
```cpp
template<typename T>
class TrieMap {
private:
    struct TrieNode {
        std::unordered_map<char, std::unique_ptr<TrieNode>> children;
        std::optional<T> value;
        bool is_end_of_word = false;
    };
    
    std::unique_ptr<TrieNode> root_;
    
public:
    void insert(const std::string& key, const T& value);
    std::optional<T> find(const std::string& key) const;

Performance Design
==================

The LiarsDice engine is designed with performance in mind while maintaining code clarity.

Memory Management
-----------------

- RAII principles throughout
- Smart pointers for automatic cleanup
- Move semantics for efficient transfers

Threading
---------

- Single-threaded game logic for simplicity
- Thread-safe dependency injection container
- Concurrent AI analysis where appropriate

Optimization Strategies
======================

- Link-time optimization (LTO) in release builds
- Profile-guided optimization support
- Efficient algorithms and data structures

# External Dependencies Directory

This directory is reserved for external libraries and dependencies that may be
downloaded or installed during the build process. Currently empty as the project
uses CMake's FetchContent for dependency management (e.g., Google Test).

# Examples of what might go here:
# - Third-party libraries not available through package managers
# - Git submodules for external dependencies
# - Downloaded archives of specific library versions
# - Custom builds of modified external libraries

Keep this directory in version control to ensure the build system can create
necessary subdirectories during configuration.
